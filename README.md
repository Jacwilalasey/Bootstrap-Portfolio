# Bootstrap-Portfolio

## Description 

Reinventing my portfolio using Bootstrap, the website outline who I am, what I can help you with and some of my most recent projects. Throughout this challenge I used a combination of HTML & CSS, focusing on utilising my newly learned knowledge around Bootstrap, using col-lg/col-sm etc. functions to set alignments across my site, and utilising the premade card system for my work section.
